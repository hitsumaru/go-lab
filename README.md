## Introduction

It's my first contact with Go and I followed tutorial from [Golang Tutorial for Beginners | Full Go Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I&pp=ugMICgJwdBABGAE%3D)

This project is a simple CLI application about booking tickets. You could reserve tickets passing name, email and the number of tickets. There is input directives to receive this data and it is outputed data about reservation. 
With this project I've had contact with:
- local setup
- variables and constants
- input and output
- data types
- pointers
- arrays and slices
- loops and conditionals
- functions
- packages
- maps
- structs 
- goroutines

Altough been a simple and an introduction course it has been passed essentially basics about Go.

Honestly I found Go amazing! 
Sintax, performance, structure and possibility to work from top to low level made my interest about this language increase. I know there is much more so I'll keep studying and practicing with other projects and try to follow other tutorials before enter in a solid project by myself. Feel free to search other projects here.
